# circonusllhist
A golang implementation of the OpenHistogram [libcircllhist](https://github.com/openhistogram/libcircllhist) library.

## Overview
Package `circllhist` provides an implementation of OpenHistogram's fixed log-linear histogram data structure.  This allows tracking 
of histograms in a composable way such that accurate error can be reasoned about.
